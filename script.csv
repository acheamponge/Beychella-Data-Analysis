Okay, ladies
Now let's get in formation
Okay, ladies
Now let's get in formation
You know you that bitch
When you cause all this conversation
Always stay gracious
Best revenge is your paper
I think what you're trying to ask is, uh,
why am I so insistent upon...
giving out to them that Blackness,
that Black Power, that Black...
Pushing them to identify
with, uh, Black culture.
I think that is what you're asking.
I have no choice over it
in the first place.
To me, we are the most beautiful creatures
in the whole world;
Black people.
My job is to somehow
make them curious enough,
or persuade them,
by hook or crook,
to get more aware of themselves
and where they came from
and what they are into,
and what is already there
and just to bring it out.
This is what compels me to compel them.
And I will do it
by whatever means necessary.
Which one do you think is better?
I mean, I think we could use
another music run-through...
Okay.
And get all the departments
because...
the people who haven't seen the show,
like seen the run-through over there,
are super unclear on what the vibe is.
- What this is.
- Yeah.
Agreed.
I'm with you.
People who have just saw it...
Then they got it.
They just now getting it. Got it.
Okay, so can we see
if it's a good time to do that?
They can be here til' eight.
- What time is it?
- It's 6:30.
Let's go.
- Go over there?
- Yeah.
I grew up in Houston, Texas,
visiting Prairie View.
We rehearsed at TSU
for many years in Third Ward,
and I always dreamed of going to an HBCU.
My college wasDestiny's Child.
My college was traveling around the world,
and life was my teacher.
I wanted a Black orchestra.
I wanted the steppers,
I needed the vocalists.
I wanted different characters;
I didn't want us all doing the same thing.
And the amount of swag
is just limitless. Like...
the things that these young people can do
with their bodies,
and the music they can play, and...
the drumrolls, and the haircuts,
and the bodies, and the...
It's just not right.
It's just so much damn swag.
It's just gorgeous,
and it makes me proud. And, um...
I wanted every person
that has ever been dismissed
because of the way they look
to feel like they were on that stage.
Killing 'em.Killing 'em.
And I want this to be, uh...
an experience where we all have growth,
we all have to push ourselves
and have to dig deep inside of ourselves
to become better human beings.
And I wanna start off with a prayer.
All right.
God, thank you so much for everyone here.
Thank you for bringing
all of these human beings into my life.
God, I ask
that this is an experience that...
we all remember forever.
I ask that we're able to touch people
and give them hope.
To make people feel beautiful, strong...
and united.
God, I ask that you just use us.
I ask that we all grow,
and we all connect.
And Lord,
thank you so much for choosing us.
Thank you for bringing everyone here
into my life.
We give you all the praise and glory,
amen.
Amen.
So, I want us to have fun
and just, we have so much to learn.
'Cause we're here to rehearse,
and eventually we'll get on that stage
and just let it all go,
and feel the spirit
and have us a good time.
But, right now,it's still janky,
and we got so much to learn
and work out.
So I wanted us
to feel each other's energy,
and dance, and scream,
and holler, and hoot.
Do whatever we feel naturally.
And we're gonna build this thing together.
So let's just do it.
Let me hear you sing.
- Sorry
- I ain't sorry
- Sorry
- I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
Nigga, nah
- Sorry
- I ain't sorry
- Sorry
- I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
He trying to roll me up
I ain't picking up
I'm headed to the club
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Me and my ladies sip my D'USS cup
I don't give a fuck
Chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause
Bug a Boos.
I need a good laugh.
You.
Make me laugh.
Bug a Boos!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ah, ah, ah!
We got you, right?
That is so funny!
Did that make us laugh?
No!
Think about it.
Bug a Boos!
Fall in line.
Ladies.
Ladies.
Ladies.
Are we smart?
Yes!
Are we strong?
Yes!
Have we had enough of the bullshit?
Yes!
Show me.
Suck...
On my balls!
Suck on my balls!
Suck on my balls, bitch!
Suck...
On my balls!
Suck on my balls, pause!

Hell nah!
Middle fingers up!
Middle fingers up!

Let's go.
Tell him boy, bye
Tell him, tell him boy, bye
Tell him boy, bye
Tell him, tell him boy, bye
Tell him boy, bye
Tell him, tell him boy, bye
I ain't thinking about you!
Middle fingers up
Put 'em hands high
Wave 'em in his face
Tell him boy, bye
Tell him boy, bye
Boy, bye
Middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry
No, no, hell, nah
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
Can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Foolish of me to dream
While you cheat...
With what?
With loose women
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I've realized I've got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I've got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I see you. How did you do that so fast?
She has on my outfit, y'all.
- Sing it
- Me, myself, and I
- Sing it
- That's all I've got
In the end
Found out
Sing it, ladies.
From now on
I'm gon' be my own best friend
Right, ladies?
Yes.
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it
I'll be far away
I'm far away
I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear
Fall down my eye
Me and my baby, we gon' be all right
Gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
Better call Becky with the good hair
He better call
Becky with the good hair
I rock diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since 15, coming down, repping Texas
How you gon' neglect this?
You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone
You ain't got to lie, Craig
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
Let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go
Let's go, little kitty cat
- He don't want no mo'
- Let's go, little kitty cat
He better call Becky
With the good hair
Coachella!
Thank y'all so much
for having us once again.
I'm so honored
to be on this stage tonight.
This next song is for all of my queens.
Do we have any beautiful queens
in the house tonight?
I want y'all to sing along
if you know the lyrics.
It's called ""Bow Down.""
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that
Bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
Don't think I'm justhis little wife
Don't get it twisted
Get it twisted

Tell me, who gon' take me off?
Take me off
Take me off
Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what's good
Kiss my momma, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your boo was talking lip
Guess what I did
Smack that trick
Smack that trick
- Guess what I did
- Smack that trick
Gold everything
Gold-ass rings, gold-ass chains
Gold-ass fangs
You can see me stunt
When you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt
When you turn on ya screen
I'm bigger than life
My name in the lights
I'm the capital B
I don't need no hype
The capital B mean
I'm 'bout that life
The capital B mean
I'm 'bout that life
Bitch
Do one more!
When I decided to do Coachella,
instead of me pulling out my flower crown,
it was more important
that I brought our culture to Coachella.
There was a four-month period
of rehearsals
with Derek and the band before we started
the four months of dance rehearsals.
The music and those vocal rehearsals...
that's the heartbeat of the show.
Good hair
I wanted
all of these different characters,
and I wanted it to feel the way I felt
when I went to battle of the bands,
because I grew up seeing those shows,
and that being the highlight of my year.
Five, six, seven, go.
Five, swipe, right, left,
swipe, step, clap.
So I studied my history,
I studied my past,
and I put every mistake,
all of my triumphs,
of my 22-year career
into my two-hour homecoming performance.
Looking at what she wanted
to bring to the community,
and caring about current events,
and caring about what, you know,
her people are going through,
and wanting to shed light,
and wanting to put, you know,
a proud moment on stage for us,
it gives you a boost. It's like, ""Wow!""
They heard her say it
without saying it.
""Let's get it together.
Let's move forward, let's unify.""
All of those things existed
in this performance.
It felt like we were all connected,
and it literally felt like we were
in our own university
and struggling together.
The hours were unbelievable.
We did a pass without any music.
And just to hear the energy
in all the stops, and...
to feel the shaking
of the risers on the pyramid,
to hear the harmonies live
was just as entertaining.
I been drinking, I been drinking
I get filthy
When that liquor get into me
I've been thinking
I've been thinking
Why can't I
Keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na, na
Why can't I
Keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na, na
Coachella, I wanna hear y'all sing.
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal
With these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na, na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
Drunk in love
How y'all doing over here?
I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
I can see you all the way.
All the way back there.
We be all night
Last thing I remember is
Our beautiful bodies
Grinding off in that club
Drunk in love
Sing it, y'all!
We be all night
Sing.
Come on, sing!
We be all night
Sing.
Hey
Hey
We be all night
Everything alright
No complaints for my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking
Park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac
Gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wear it out
Boy, I'm drinking
I'm singing on the mic
Till my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard
Surfboard, bring it on
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'- grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on it
Swervin'- swervin' on it
His big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surf
Good, good
Hey
I lost myself on a cool, damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under the lilac tree
But I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more
Than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Last thing I remember is
Our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night
Sing it.
Hey
We be all night
Ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard
Surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'- grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on it
Swerve-swervin' on it
His big body been
Surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'- grainin' on that wood
Swervin' on it
Swerve-swervin' on
His big body been serving all this
Surfing all over this good-good
To the left, to the left

What you say?
She ain't no diva
No, no, no
Divas, y'all help me sing

Here we go.
Since 15 in my stilettos
Been struttin' in this game
""What's yo' age?"" was the question
They ask when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her
You see how she gettin' paid
She aint' calling him to greet him
Don't need him, her bed's made
- This is a stick-up, stick-up
- I need them bags, all that money
- This is a stick-up, stick-up
- You see them ask
All my ladies get it up
I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level
No passengers on my plane
I be getting to the money
Everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money
Everybody mad
Same old nigga from the block
Same old nigga with the pot
Same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him
Then he bounced right back

Everybody mad
I think I'm getting too much money
Everybody mad
Same old nigga from the block
Same old nigga with the pot
Same old nigga from the trap
Everybody hated on him
Then he bounced right back
Getting to the money
I was supposed to do Coachella
the year prior.
But...
I got pregnant unexpectedly.
And it ended up being twins,
which was even more of a surprise.
My body went through more
than I knew it could.
I was 218 pounds the day I gave birth.
I had an extremely difficult pregnancy.
I had high blood pressure,
I developedtoxemia, preeclampsia,
and, in the womb,
one of my babies' heartbeat
paused a few times,
so I had to get an emergency C-section.
Home is something very peculiar.
There is a yearning in it, you know?
Something special, mystical, hopeful,
restful.
Here we go. First combination.
- First...
- I been getting to.
That go:
I been getting to.
It's my first time back home,
on the stage, after giving birth.
I'm creating my own homecoming.
And it's hard.
There were days that I thought, you know,
I'd never be the same.
I'd never be the same physically,
my strength and endurance
would never be the same.
Between SoulCycle
and coming in here,
- you're losing like 1,500-2,000 calories.
- Calories, yeah.
It's true. And, eventually,
I wanna be able to do SoulCycle,
the stairs, and rehearse in a day.
Okay. Lit. I'll be right there with you.
And you know, a lot of the choreography
is about feeling,
so it's not as technical.
It's your own personality
that brings it to life.
And that's hard
when you don't feel like yourself.
I had to rebuild my body
from cut muscles.
It took me a while
to feel confident enough to freak it,
and give it my own personality.
In the beginning,
it was so many muscle spasms.
Just, internally,
my body was not connected.
My mind was not there.
My mind wanted to be with my children.
What people don't see is the sacrifice.
I would dance, and go off to the trailer,
and breastfeed the babies,
and the days I could,
I would bring the children.
Like, it gets messy.
Like, it's this...
I'm not even joking, this fast.
Yes.
- It's doable, but...
- It's fast.
That's why...
That's why I said to take it out.
- This is grounding.
- Yes.
Like, no matter who you are,
- you get in here, and it's real.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's what people don't get. That's why...
That's why people don't like to rehearse.
- You gotta be humble.
- Uh-huh.
You gotta be willing
to look awkward, and...
you gotta study, be a student.
I might...
pass out!
Five, six. Five, six, let's go.
- Hup!
- Again.
- Hup!
- Now release it.
Hup!
One more.
- Hup!
- Let's go!
Hup!
Well, I feel a little of the jerkiness...
is going now.
In order for me to meet my goal,
I'm limiting myself to no bread, no carbs,
no sugar, no dairy,
no meat, no fish, no alcohol.
And I'm hungry.
Just trying to figure out how to balance
being a mother of a six-year-old
and of twins that need me
and giving myself creatively
and, um, physically.
It was a lot to juggle.
It's not like before,
when I could rehearse,
you know, 15 hours straight.
I have children, I have a husband.
I have to take care of my body.
There she is.
Hi, my babies!
Hi, Baba! Hi, baby!
Hi, this is me!
I definitely pushed myself
further than I knew I could.
And I've learned a very valuable lesson...
I will never...
...never push myself that far again.
I feel like I'm just a new...
A new woman, in a new chapter of my life,
and I'm not even trying to be who I was.
It's just so beautiful that children...
do that to you.
- You have to get three turns.
- Okay, best out of three.
Okay, this is seriously
a huge accomplishment.
Because I did not think
I'd ever get back in my old costume,
and I'm actually in it.
And I can still move...
I still have a ways to go,
but this makes me feel good,
'cause I've been sacrificing
and working hard.
- Huge, huge, huge accomplishment. Yay!
- Ooh!
Are you going to wear it
for rehearsals?
- No, I'm not!
- Okay.
You're gonna go out to dinner in it?
No.
Although, I do wanna tell...
go show Jay. It's a big deal.
Why don't you take a walk across the...
I ain't walking there.
Doing too much.
Hi. Can we talk to Mr. Carter, please?
Of course.
- Yup.
- I'm back in my costume.
All right!
Big deal!
- All right!
- It's zipped.
All right. Just had to share.
Why aren't guys as excited?
Crown me
I woke up
I woke up, woke up with the crown
Woke up with the crown. I
It's that Yonc, your Yonc
In that lingerie, on that chardonnay
Scoring touchdowns on your runway
I'm Texas forever, like Bun B
And I'm Redboned, yo
I'm really rit' like Donjae
I'm camo in here yo
These thots can't clock me nowadays
You wish I was your pound cake
Boy, you know I look good as fuck
Wish I was your baby momma
Come around and give me good karma
But no, we escalating

My name is Edidiong Emah.
I am originally from Nigeria,
grew up in Atlanta, and...
this dream is something that I never
could dream up for myself.
I couldn't dream this big at all.
I never thought I would be here,
thought I would be too short, too thick.
Actually, my whole family
went to Morehouse and Spelman,
which are HBCUs in Atlanta.
So to do this and...
to have, you know,
the Pan and, you know,
sororities and things that...
Black families value
up on a stage for the world to see
and understand us a little bit more...
It's just all a blessing.
I just toss it up,
and catch it in my spirit first,
and then real life second.
In each of us,
another woman or a young girl
might see a reflection of herself;
of her worth, of her boundless potential.
The youth need to see
their greatness reflected in our eyes.
Go forth. Let them know we're real.
Well...
I waited 37 weeks...
to be here.
Being pregnant, so...
I didn't dance for a year.
Looking out there into that crowd,
I was overwhelmed
and I feel so honored and so great
being a part of something so epic,
that my son can watch
when he's older and...
identify with the people,
identify with the culture.
And I'm just so honored
to be a part of something
that he can watch,
and be proud of me, and say,
""My mom was a part of that,
my mom did that.""
It's hard to believe that,
after all these years,
I was the first African-American woman
to headline Coachella.
It was important to me that everyone
that had never seen themselves represented
felt like they were
on that stage with us.
As a Black woman,
I used to feel like the world wanted me
to stay in my little box.
And Black women often feel underestimated.
I wanted us to be proud
of not only the show, but...
the process.
Proud of the struggle.
Thankful for the beauty that comes
with a painful history
and rejoice in the pain.
Rejoice in the imperfections
and the wrongs that are so damn right.
And I wanted everyone
to feel grateful for their curves,
their sass, their honesty,
thankful for their freedom.
It was no rules,
and we were able to create
a free,safe space
where none of us were marginalized.
Who the fuck do you think I am?
You ain't married
To no average bitch, boy
You can watch this fat ass twist, boy
As I bounce to the next dick, boy
And keep your money, I got my own
Keep a bigger smile on my face
Being alone
Bad motherfucker, God complex
I motivate your ass
Call me Malcom X
Yo, operator
Innovator
Fuck you, hater
You can't recreate her, no
You'll never recreate her, no
Hell no
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, babe
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, babe
Don't hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself
When you play me
You play yourself
Don't play yourself
When you lie to me
You lie to yourself
You're only lying to yourself
When you hurt me
You hurt yourself
Don't hurt yourself
You just gotta let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, babe
Hey baby
who the fuck do you think I am?
I smell that fragrance
On your Louis V, boy
Just give this fat ass a big kiss, boy
Tonight I'm fucking up
All your shit, boy
The most disrespected person
in America is the Black woman.
I am the dragon breathing fire
The most unprotected person
in America is the Black woman.
Beautiful mane
I'm the lion
The most neglected person
in America is the Black woman.
Beautiful man, I know you're lying
This is your final warning
You know I give you life
If you try this shit again
You gon' lose your wife
Told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
But you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
Still don't care, but that's okay
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care
Baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care
Baby
Oh! Ever since you knew your power
You made me cry
And now every time our love goes sour
You can't sympathize
You see these tears
Falling down to my ears
I swear you like when I'm in pain
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care
Well, that's okay
Listen, hey
Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care
Baby
Oh, I care
I k"
